      <p ><strong>Roper dryers</strong> are known for their durability and simplicity, but like all
        home appliances, they can develop problems over time. Some common issues include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Heating element failures</strong>: If your Roper dryer isn’t producing enough heat, clothes will take
            longer to dry, or remain damp. This is often due to a faulty heating element, which our technicians can quickly
            diagnose and replace with <strong>genuine Roper parts</strong>.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Faulty thermal fuses</strong>: A blown thermal fuse can prevent your dryer from turning on. Our
            technicians can easily replace faulty fuses to restore your dryer’s functionality.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Broken belts or motors</strong>: A broken belt or motor can cause the drum to stop spinning, leaving your
            clothes wet. Our technicians can replace worn belts or motors to get your dryer back in working order.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Control panel issues</strong>: Malfunctioning control panels or timer switches can cause your dryer to
            operate improperly or not at all. Our team can troubleshoot and fix these problems, ensuring your dryer runs
            smoothly.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Sensor malfunctions</strong>: Modern Roper dryers have sensors that help regulate drying cycles. If the
            sensors fail, the dryer may over-dry or under-dry clothes. Our technicians can identify and resolve sensor issues,
            restoring proper drying cycles.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
