      <p ><strong>Fisher &amp; Paykel dryers</strong> are known for their innovative designs and
        efficiency, but like any appliance, they can encounter problems over time. Common issues include <strong>heating
          element failures</strong>, which result in clothes not drying properly, or <strong>thermal fuse
          malfunctions</strong>, which can prevent the dryer from turning on. <strong>Sensor malfunctions</strong> can lead to
        incorrect drying cycles, while <strong>belt and motor failures</strong> can stop the drum from spinning.
        <strong>Control panel issues</strong> can also cause the dryer to become unresponsive or operate incorrectly.</p>
