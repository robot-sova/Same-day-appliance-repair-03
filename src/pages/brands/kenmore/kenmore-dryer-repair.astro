<p  ><strong>Kenmore dryers</strong> are well-known for their reliability and value, but like
  all appliances, they can experience common issues over time. Some typical problems include <strong>heating element
    failures</strong>, where the dryer doesn’t generate enough heat to dry clothes effectively, or <strong>faulty
    thermal fuses</strong>, which can prevent the dryer from turning on. <strong>Blower wheel issues</strong> are also
  common with Kenmore dryers, causing inefficient airflow and extended drying times. Additionally, <strong>control panel
    failures</strong> and <strong>sensor malfunctions</strong> can lead to improper drying cycles or an unresponsive
  machine.</p>
