              You may refer to the price list on our website to get an idea of
              what it might cost. While our price list offers a preliminary
              estimate, remember that only a qualified technician can accurately
              diagnose the issue with your appliance. Often, what a customer
              assumes to be the problem can turn out to be something completely
              different, ranging from a basic issue like a malfunctioning outlet
              to more complex problems like a faulty compressor.
