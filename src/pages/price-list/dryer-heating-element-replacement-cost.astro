      <h2>What is a Dryer Heating Element?</h2>
      <p>
        The heating element in a dryer is a crucial component that generates the
        heat needed to dry your clothes. It's essentially a coil or a group of
        coils that become hot when electricity is passed through them. Over
        time, these elements can burn out or become defective, leading to a
        dryer that won't heat up.
      </p>

      <h2>Signs You Need Your Heating Element Replaced</h2>
      <p>
        &bull; No heat in the dryer: The most obvious sign that your heating
        element might need replacing.<br /><br />
        &bull; Dryer takes longer to dry clothes: Inefficient heating can significantly
        increase drying times.<br /><br />
        &bull; Dryer overheats: A malfunctioning element can cause the dryer to overheat.
      </p>
      <p>
        Recognizing these issues early can save you time and prevent further
        damages to your appliance.
