      <h2>What is a Dryer Thermal Fuse?</h2>
      <p>
        A thermal fuse is a safety device located in dryers designed to stop the
        dryer from overheating. When the dryer gets too hot, the fuse melts,
        cutting power to prevent fire hazards. While this is an essential safety
        feature, once the fuse blows, it must be replaced for the dryer to
        operate again.
      </p>
