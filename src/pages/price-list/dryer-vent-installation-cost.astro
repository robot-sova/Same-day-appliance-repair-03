      <h3>Signs Your Dryer Needs a Vent Installation</h3>
      <h4>1. Slow Drying Times</h4>
      <p>
        If your clothes are taking longer than usual to dry, it could be a sign
        of poor ventilation. A clogged or inadequate vent restricts airflow,
        making it harder for your dryer to expel moisture efficiently.
      </p>

      <h4>2. Excessive Lint Buildup</h4>
      <p>
        Check the lint trap after each cycle. If you notice an unusually large
        amount of lint, it might indicate that the vent isn't properly removing
        lint and moisture from the dryer. This buildup can pose a fire hazard
        and reduce dryer performance.
      </p>

      <h4>3. Overheating Dryer</h4>
      <p>
        An overheating dryer is a red flag for ventilation issues. If the
        exterior of your dryer feels excessively hot to the touch or if you
        notice a burning smell during operation, it's crucial to address the
        ventilation system promptly.
      </p>

      <h4>4. Mold or Mildew Odors</h4>
      <p>
        Poor ventilation can lead to moisture buildup in the dryer, creating an
        environment conducive to mold and mildew growth. If you detect musty
        odors coming from your dryer or laundry area, it's a sign that the
        ventilation system needs attention.
      </p>

      <h4>5. Visible Lint Around the Dryer</h4>
      <p>
        Inspect the area around your dryer for visible lint accumulation. If you
        notice lint gathering on walls, floors, or near the dryer exhaust, it
        indicates that the vent isn't effectively capturing and venting lint
        outside.
      </p>

      <h4>6. Excessive Humidity in the Laundry Room</h4>
      <p>
        A well-functioning vent should expel moist air outside, preventing
        excessive humidity in the laundry room. If you experience consistently
        high humidity levels or condensation near the dryer, it's likely due to
        ventilation issues.
      </p>

      <h4>7. Noisy Dryer Operation</h4>
      <p>
        Unusual noises such as rattling, banging, or squealing during dryer
        operation can be caused by airflow restrictions due to a clogged or
        improperly installed vent. Addressing the ventilation system can restore
        quiet and smooth dryer operation.
      </p>

      <h4>8. Clothes Feeling Damp or Hot After Drying</h4>
      <p>
        If your clothes feel damp or excessively hot at the end of the drying
        cycle, it indicates that moisture isn't being adequately removed from
        the dryer. This can result from a vent that isn't venting properly.
