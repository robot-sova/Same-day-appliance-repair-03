                See prices below. The cost of labor depends on the complexity of
                the repair and the estimated time required. We ensure
                transparency by providing a detailed quote before you commit to
                the service. Should the repair take longer than expected, you
                won't be charged extra; we waive the diagnostic fee upon
                proceeding with the repair, ensuring no surprises on your bill.

                See prices below. While not every repair needs new parts,
                certain situations require them to restore your oven to peak
                performance. Our technicians carry a range of parts in their
                vehicles, which usually enables same-day repairs. If a part must
                be ordered, the cost will vary depending on the repair, brand,
                and model of your oven.

            <h3>Whirlpool Ovens:</h3>
            <p>
              When it comes to repairing Whirlpool ovens, several factors can
              influence the cost, including the nature of the oven issue and
              the specific model. On average, oven repair services for
              Whirlpool appliances can range from <b>$150 to $400</b>. Common
              problems like a malfunctioning oven's circuit breaker or issues
              with the self-clean cycle are usually on the lower end of the
              price spectrum, while more complex repairs involving the oven's
              electronics can be more expensive. Whirlpool ovens are known for
              their durability, but like any appliance, they require
              occasional maintenance. The cost can also be affected by whether
              the oven is a wall oven or a freestanding range. Replacement
              parts for Whirlpool ovens are generally readily available, which
              can help reduce wait times for repairs.

            <h3>GE Ovens</h3>
            <p>
              GE ovens are popular for their high-quality performance, but
              they can also encounter issues that necessitate professional
              repair. The average cost to repair a GE oven ranges from <b
                >$200 to $500</b
              >. Common problems include a lock-out indicator that stays
              locked, an oven that takes too long to preheat, or a
              malfunctioning oven door handle. If the repair involves the
              oven's circuit breaker or the replacement of other critical
              components, the price can go higher. Additionally, GE appliances
              often come with a warranty that may cover some repair costs, so
              it's always a good idea to check the warranty status before
              scheduling a repair service.

              the cost to repair a Samsung oven ranges from <b>$250 to $550</b
              >. Issues such as problems with the self-clean cycle, the oven
              taking too long to reach a safe temperature, or an oven door
              that won't stay locked are common. Repairs that involve
              replacing the oven's circuit breaker or significant electronic
              components can be more costly. Samsung also offers a warranty on
              their appliances, which can help mitigate some of the repair
              costs if the oven is still covered.

              the preheating time. LG appliances often come with a warranty,
              and checking this can help you save on repair costs. If the oven
              is part of a larger kitchen suite including other appliances
              like a dishwasher or refrigerator, consider getting a bundled

              that won't move to the unlocked position. If the repair involves
              more complex components or electronics, the cost can be higher.

              the pricier side, typically ranging from <b>$250 to $600</b>.
              Common problems include issues with the oven's circuit breaker,
              a self-clean cycle that doesn't complete, or an oven door that
              won't stay locked. These ovens often come with a warranty that

            <h3>Maytag Ovens</h3>
            <p>
              Maytag ovens are known for their durability and reliability, but
              they can still face issues that require professional repair. The
              average cost to repair a Maytag oven ranges from <b
                >$200 to $450</b
              >. Common issues include a malfunctioning oven's circuit
              breaker, problems with the self-clean cycle, or an oven door
              handle that won’t move to the unlocked position. Like other
              brands, Maytag offers warranties on their appliances, so
              checking the warranty status can help reduce repair costs. If
              you have other Maytag appliances like a washer or dryer,
              consider a bundled service for potential savings.

        <div class="questions">
          <p>Common signs that your oven may need repairs include:</p>
          <p><b>Uneven Heating</b></p>
          <p>
            If your oven consistently cooks food unevenly, leaving some parts
            undercooked while others are overcooked, it could indicate a problem
            with the heating elements or temperature regulation.
          </p>

          <p><b>Inaccurate Temperature</b></p>
          <p>
            If the oven temperature doesn't match the set temperature or
            fluctuates during cooking, it could suggest issues with the
            thermostat or temperature sensor.
          </p>

          <p><b>Failure to Heat</b></p>
          <p>
            If the oven fails to heat up at all, it may indicate a
            malfunctioning heating element, gas oven igniter, or other
            electrical components.
          </p>

          <p><b>Strange Smells</b></p>
          <p>
            Unusual odors emanating from the oven during cooking, such as a gas
            smell in gas ovens, could signify a problem with the igniter, gas
            valve, or other components. A burning smell could indicate
            electrical problems, overheating components, or even burning food
            trapped within the oven cavity.
          </p>

          <p><b>Unusual Noises</b></p>
          <p>
            Excessive noise, such as grinding, buzzing, or rattling, could
            indicate issues with the fan motor, bearings, or other mechanical
            components.
          </p>

          <p><b>Faulty Door Sealing</b></p>
          <p>
            If heat escapes from around the oven door, it may suggest a worn-out
            door gasket, compromising energy efficiency and cooking performance.
          </p>

          <p><b>Error Messages or Display Issues</b></p>
          <p>
            If the oven's control panel displays error messages, doesn't respond
            to controls, or exhibits erratic behavior, it could indicate a
            problem with the oven control board or wiring.
          </p>

          <p><b>Visible Damage</b></p>
          <p>
            Any visible damage to components like heating elements, igniters, or
            wiring should prompt further inspection and possible repair.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you notice any of these signs, it's best to contact a qualified
            appliance repair technician to diagnose the problem and recommend a
            course of action. It's important to remember that DIY oven repair
            might be dangerous and should only be performed by a professional.

        <div class="questions">
          <p><b>Type of oven</b></p>
          <p>
            The oven repair cost can vary significantly depending on whether the
            oven is electric, gas, or a specialty oven types like a pizza or
            steam oven. Electric ovens tend to need less expensive repairs than
            gas ovens.
          </p>

          <p><b>Extent of Damage</b></p>
          <p>
            The severity of the damage or malfunction affects the complexity of
            the repair and, consequently, the appliance repair cost.
          </p>

          <p><b>Parts Replacement</b></p>
          <p>
            The cost of a replacement part varies depending on the brand, model,
            and availability of components needed for certain repairs.
          </p>

          <p><b>Age of the oven</b></p>
          <p>
            Older ovens over 10 years old may need costly repairs, as
            replacement parts can be harder to find. In some cases, it may be
            more cost-effective to replace an older oven rather than repair it.
          </p>

          <p><b>Brand and Model</b></p>
          <p>
            Different oven brands and models have varying complexities in their
            designs and components, influencing an average appliance repair
            cost.
          </p>

          <p><b>Warranty Coverage</b></p>
          <p>
            If the oven is still under warranty, some or all of the appliance
            repair costs may be covered, reducing the out-of-pocket expenses for
            the owner.
          </p>
          <p>
            For minor repairs like replacing a light bulb or a knob, DIY
            appliance repair might be feasible. However, for anything more
            complex, it's safer and often more cost-effective to call a
            professional to avoid causing further damage.

          <p>- Gas ovens can last an average of 15 years.</p>
          <p>
            - Electric ovens have a slightly shorter lifespan of around 13 years
            on average.
          </p>
          <p>
            - Built-in ovens, which require more construction and installation,
            typically last around the same 13-15 years as standalone ovens.
          </p>
          <p>
            - The quality and brand of the oven can also affect its lifespan,
            with higher-quality ovens from reputable brands generally lasting
            longer than cheaper models.

          <p>
            <b
              >To help extend the life of an oven, the key recommendations are:</b
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            - Regularly clean the oven interior, exterior, and door gaskets.
          </p>
          <p>
            - Avoid relying too heavily on the self-cleaning cycle, as the high
            temperatures can wear down the oven over time.
          </p>
          <p>
            - Have the oven professionally inspected and maintained annually.
          </p>
          <p>
            - Address any issues or malfunctions promptly rather than using a
            problematic oven.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Following these maintenance tips, most ovens can reach their full
            13-15-year lifespan, or even longer in the case of high-quality gas
            models.

            <h3>What is The Cost to Repair vs. Replacing an Oven?</h3>
          </div>

          <div class="fa_plus">︾</div>

          <div class="fa_minus">︽</div>
        </div>

        <div class="questions">
          <p>
            The decision if the oven is worth fixing or should be replaced
            depends on several factors, including:
          </p>

          <p>
            <b>Extent of Damage:</b>If the oven has minor issues that are
            relatively inexpensive to repair and the appliance is otherwise in
            good condition, repairing might be more cost-effective.
          </p>

          <p>
            <b>Age of the Oven:</b>Older ovens nearing the end of their expected
            lifespan may require frequent repairs, making replacement a more
            practical long-term solution.
          </p>

          <p>
            <b>Cost to repair:</b>Compare the cost of repairing the oven with
            the average costs of purchasing a new one. If the repair costs are
            significantly high and approaching the price of a new oven,
            replacement may be a better option.
          </p>

          <p>
            <b>Energy Efficiency:</b>Newer ovens often come with
            energy-efficient features that can lead to cost savings on energy
            bills over time. Consider the potential long-term savings when
            deciding between repair and replacement.
          </p>

          <p>
            <b>Warranty Coverage:</b>If the oven is still under warranty,
            repairing it may be the preferred choice to avoid voiding the
            warranty. However, if the warranty has expired, replacement becomes
            a more viable option.
          </p>

          <p>
            <b>Desired Features:</b>If you've been considering upgrading to a
            newer model with advanced features or improved functionality,
            replacing the oven may be a better investment in the long run.
          </p>

          <p>
            Ultimately, it's essential to weigh these factors carefully and
            consider your budget, needs, and long-term plans before deciding
            whether to repair or replace your oven. Consulting with a
            professional appliance technician can also provide valuable insights
            to help you make an informed decision.

          <p>
            Several factors influence the cost-effectiveness of each option when
            deciding whether to repair or replace an oven.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Repair Cost:</b>Consider the total oven repair costs, including
            replacement parts and labor. If the repair costs are substantial and
            approaching or exceeding the price of a new oven, replacement might
            be more financially sensible in the long run.
          </p>

          <p>
            <b>Extent of Damage:</b>Evaluate the nature and severity of the
            oven's issues. Minor repairs, such as replacing a heating element or
            thermostat, may be relatively inexpensive and worthwhile if they
            restore the oven's functionality. However, if the damage is
            extensive or affects critical components like the control board or
            gas safety valve, appliance repair costs can escalate quickly.
          </p>

          <p>
            <b>Age and Condition:</b>Assess the age and overall condition of the
            oven. While older ovens can often be repaired, they may be more
            prone to developing additional problems in the future. If your oven
            is nearing the end of its expected lifespan or has required frequent
            repairs in the past, investing in a new appliance may be a more
            reliable solution.
          </p>

          <p>
            <b>Energy Efficiency:</b>Newer ovens are typically more
            energy-efficient than older models, offering potential long-term
            savings on utility bills. If your current oven is outdated and
            consumes more energy than modern equivalents, upgrading to a newer,
            more efficient model could be economically advantageous despite the
            initial higher cost.
          </p>

          <p>
            <b>Desired Features:</b>Consider whether your existing oven meets
            your cooking needs and preferences. If you desire additional
            features, improved performance, or enhanced convenience that your
            current oven lacks, investing in a new appliance may provide greater
            satisfaction and utility in the kitchen.
          </p>

          <p>
            <b>Warranty and Reliability:</b>New ovens often come with
            manufacturer warranties, protecting against defects and unexpected
            repairs. Additionally, newer models may offer improved reliability
            and durability compared to older appliances, reducing the likelihood
            of future repair expenses.
          </p>

          <p>
            Ultimately, the decision to repair or replace your oven depends on
            these factors and your individual circumstances and preferences.
            Consulting with a qualified appliance technician can help you assess
            your options and make an informed choice that best suits your needs
            and budget.

        <div class="questions">
          <p>
            Deciding whether it's worth repairing a 10-year-old oven depends on
            several factors:
          </p>

          <p>
            <b>Extent of Damage:</b>Assess the nature and extent of the oven's
            problem. If a minor repair is necessary and to restore the oven's
            functionality for a significant period, it might be worthwhile.
          </p>

          <p>
            <b>Repair Cost:</b>Compare the cost of repairing the oven to the
            expense of purchasing a new one. If the repair prices are relatively
            low compared to the price of a new oven, repairing may be a
            cost-effective option.
          </p>

          <p>
            <b>Oven Condition:</b>Consider the overall condition of the oven. If
            it has been well-maintained, shows minimal wear and tear, and has
            performed reliably over the years, investing in repairs to extend
            its lifespan could be justified.
          </p>

          <p>
            <b>Frequency of Repairs:</b>If the oven has required frequent
            repairs in the past or if multiple components are failing
            simultaneously, it may indicate that the appliance is reaching the
            end of its serviceable life. In such cases, investing in a new oven
            might be more prudent than continuing to repair an aging appliance.
          </p>

          <p>
            <b>Energy Efficiency:</b>Newer ovens are often more energy-efficient
            than older models, which can lead to long-term cost savings on
            energy bills. If your current oven is energy-inefficient, replacing
            it with a newer, more efficient model may be a wiser investment in
            the long run.
          </p>

          <p>
            <b>Desired Features:</b>Consider whether your current oven meets
            your cooking needs and preferences. If you desire modern features,
            improved performance, or enhanced convenience that your existing
            oven lacks, upgrading to a new model may offer greater satisfaction
            and utility.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ultimately, deciding to repair or replace a 10-year-old oven depends
            on your circumstances, budget, and priorities. Consulting with a
            qualified appliance technician can provide valuable insights and
            guidance to help you make an informed choice.

            <h3>Why does my stove work but not my oven?</h3>
          </div>

          <div class="fa_plus">︾</div>

          <div class="fa_minus">︽</div>
        </div>

        <div class="questions">
          <p>
            When your stove works but the oven breaks, there could be several
            reasons behind this issue:
          </p>
          <p>
            <b> Gas Supply Issue:</b> If you have a gas oven, but the stove (which
            typically operates on gas) works fine while the oven does not, there
            might be an issue with the gas supply specifically to the oven. This
            could be due to a malfunctioning gas valve or a blockage in the oven's
            supply line.
          </p>

          <p>
            <b>Igniter Problems:</b>Gas ovens use an igniter to ignite the gas
            and create the flame necessary for heating. If the oven igniter is
            faulty or not working correctly, it can prevent the oven from
            heating up while allowing the stove burners to function normally.
          </p>

          <p>
            <b>Thermostat Malfunction:</b>The oven thermostat regulates the
            temperature by controlling the flow of gas or electricity to the
            heating elements. If the thermostat is defective or out of
            calibration, it may not signal the oven to heat up properly even
            though the stove burners work fine.
          </p>

          <p>
            <b>Faulty Heating Element:</b>Electric ovens rely on these to
            generate heat. If one or more of these elements is faulty or burned
            out, it can prevent the oven from heating while the stove continues
            to operate normally.
          </p>

          <p>
            <b>Control Panel Malfunctions:</b>The control board serves as the
            "brain" of the oven, governing its various functions and settings.
            If the control board is malfunctioning or has failed, it may not
            send the necessary signals to the oven components to initiate the
            heating process.
          </p>

          <p>
            <b>Wiring Problems:</b>An electric oven requires proper wiring to
            supply power to the heating elements and other components. If there
            are issues with the wiring, such as loose connections or damaged
            wires, it can disrupt the flow of electricity to the oven while
            allowing the stove to function.
          </p>

          <p>
            <b>Internal Component Failures:</b>Various components within the
            oven, such as relays, switches, or sensors, can fail over time due
            to wear and tear or other factors. If any of these components fail,
            the oven may not heat correctly while the stove remains operational.
          </p>
          <p>
            While some oven and stove repairs may seem straightforward, it's
            essential to recognize that attempting DIY repairs can pose risks,
            especially if you're not familiar with appliance maintenance or lack
            the necessary skills and tools. Additionally, the cost to repair any
            mistakes made during the DIY process can outweigh the savings.
          </p>
          <p>
            To determine the exact cause of the issue, it's recommended to have
            a qualified appliance technician inspect and diagnose your oven.
            They can identify the underlying problem and recommend the
            appropriate oven repair to restore its functionality.
