            Keeping air ducts clean is essential for the optimal performance of
            your AC system and the health of the Home members. Dirty air ducts
            can cause allergies, asthma, poor immunity, and bad sleep.
            Sometimes, moisture will accumulate in the air ducts as water
            droplets instead of evaporating. This gives mold spores the moisture
            they need to form colonies. In such a situation, the spores will use
            dust, dead skin cells, and dirt as food sources.

                Regular cleaning is essential for your duct's optimal
                performance and the health of the Home members. If the air ducts
                are dirty, the evaporator coil is also dirty, which means the
                system is not working effectively. We recommend air duct
                cleaning as soon as you sense that the air in your house is not
                clean. Our fee for this comprehensive service varies from $200
                to $450, depending on the unit type.
              </p>

                This preventive approach not only saves you money by reducing
                the need for repairs but also enhances the efficiency and
                lifespan of your appliance. Schedule your maintenance
                appointment with us today and ensure your air duct runs
                smoothly.

              How are air duct cleaning costs calculated by square footage and
              number of vents?
            </h3>
          </div>

          <div class="fa_minus">︽</div>
        </div>

        <div class="questions">
          <p>
            Air duct cleaning costs are primarily calculated based on the square
            footage of your home and the number of vents or air ducts present in
            the HVAC system. Professional air duct cleaning services often use
            these two factors to determine the overall cleaning cost.
          </p>
          <p>
            Firstly, the square footage of the space plays a crucial role as it
            directly affects the extent of ductwork that needs to be cleaned.
            Prices might be set per square foot or based on the size categories
            of the home (e.g., under 2000 square feet, 2000-3000 square feet,
            etc.). This method helps ensure that the cleaning cost is
            proportional to the size of the air duct system.
          </p>
          <p>
            Secondly, the number of vents is another significant factor. Each
            vent represents an additional point that requires cleaning, and more
            vents mean more labor and time spent on the job. The air duct
            cleaning cost can increase with the number of supply vents and
            return air vents because each needs to be individually cleaned to
            maintain good indoor air quality.
          </p>
          <p>
            Typically, professional air duct cleaning companies might offer a
            base rate for a certain number of vents and square footage, with
            additional charges applied for extra vents or higher square footage.
            This pricing structure ensures that the air duct cleaning service is
            thorough, covering all necessary areas of the HVAC system to improve
            energy efficiency and enhance the home's air quality by removing
            dust, debris, and other airborne particles from the duct surfaces.
