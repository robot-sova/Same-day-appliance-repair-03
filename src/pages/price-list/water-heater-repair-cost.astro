                Regular maintenance is essential for your water heater's
                longevity and optimal performance. We recommend annual
                maintenance, which includes inspecting tanks and connections for
                leaks, testing temperature-pressure relief valves, checking and
                replacing anode rods, flushing tanks to remove sediment,
                adjusting thermostat settings, cleaning burner, and ignition
                components, descaling tankless systems, ensuring all valves and
                filters are functioning properly. Our fee for this comprehensive
                service varies from $200 to $450, depending on the unit type.

                expected, you won't be charged extra; we waive the diagnostic

            Considering the option of DIY appliance repair for simpler tasks,
            such as replacing a door latch or belt, can be a cost-effective way
            to save on labor costs. However, it's important to weigh the pros
            and cons of DIY repairs. While you may only need to pay for
            replacement parts, DIY repairs can take longer and may not offer the
            specialized knowledge and safety assurance that professional
            technicians provide.
