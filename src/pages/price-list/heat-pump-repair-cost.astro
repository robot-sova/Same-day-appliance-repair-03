                Regular maintenance is essential for your heat pump's longevity
                and optimal performance. We recommend annual maintenance, which
                includes inspecting and cleaning filters, checking and
                tightening electrical connections, cleaning ducts, blower, and
                indoor coil, measuring airflow, checking refrigerant levels and
                pressure, cleaning the condensate drain, calibrating the
                thermostat, lubricating moving parts, inspecting the outdoor
                unit, checking system controls, examining the heat exchanger,
                and observing the system's start-up and shutdown cycles to
                ensure efficient operation and prevent breakdowns. Our fee for
                this comprehensive service varies from $200 to $450, depending
                on the unit type.
              </p>

                This preventive approach not only saves you money by reducing
                the need for repairs but also enhances the efficiency and
                lifespan of your appliance. Schedule your maintenance

                See prices below. The cost of labor depends on the complexity of
                the heat pump repair and the estimated time required. We ensure
                transparency by providing a detailed quote before you commit to
                the service. Should the repair take longer than expected, you
                won't be charged extra; we waive the diagnostic fee upon
                proceeding with the repair, and you will pay the cost of the
                repair and parts if needed.

                See prices below. While not every repair needs new parts,
                certain situations require replacement parts to restore your
                heat pump to peak performance. Our technicians carry various
                parts in their vehicles, which usually enables same-day repairs.
                If a part must be ordered, the cost will vary depending on the
                repair, brand, and model of your heat pump.
